Municipal Population Data Interpolation
Description
This project compiles and cleans municipal population data from the INEGI censuses of 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. The 2015 census contains 32 different files, all of which, along with the files from other years, were meticulously cleaned and merged. The final dataset includes interpolated population data for the years 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018 at the municipal level in Mexico.

Project Details
Data Sources
INEGI censuses for the years:
2000

2020
Process
Data Compilation: Collected population data from all mentioned INEGI censuses.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned each file to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Data Merging: Merged all cleaned files into a universal database.
Data Interpolation: Interpolated census data to estimate population figures for the years 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018 at the municipal level.
